# md2html


md2html is a simple tool to convert your markdown file to pure html with some basic css style, you can use this simple tool with GitHub pages , you will find it very easy to build a static web site , Also we have prepared some basic css for you, of course if you know some css you can edit the style as you like.


Jekyll is too heavy for me, and jekyll is base on Ruby , Ruby is not family to me , Also in some country for some reason like GFW you should have a vpn to access the RubyGems. When you have more markdown file you will find Jekyll is slow , Becouse Jekyll rerender the whole markdown file everytime you build.
A simple md2html tool is enough for me .


enjoy!
